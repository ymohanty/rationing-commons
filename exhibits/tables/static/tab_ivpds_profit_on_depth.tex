	\multicolumn{5}{p{0.96\hsize}}{\footnotesize The table reports coefficients from regressions of agricultural profit measures on well depth and controls. The data is from the main agricultural household survey and the observations are at the farmer-by-crop level. The dependent variable changes in each panel. In Panel A, the dependent variable is total profit, which includes the value of the farmer's own consumption (INR per Ha). Where no profit is reported in cash, and the farmer keeps all the output for own consumption, we impute the total profit variable by adding the value of output consumed \and subtracting the input costs associated with the output. The price used in this imputation for each crop is taken to be the median market price for the crop reported at the SDO level.  In Panel B, the dependent variable is reported cash profit (INR per Ha). Well depth is the reported depth of a given farmer's well. Toposequence includes controls for elevation and slope. Subdivisional effects are dummy variables for each of the six sub-divisional offices of the distribution company from which farmers were sampled. Plot size effects are dummy variables indicating the plot size decile for each farmer-crop based on its plot area. Standard errors are clustered at the feeder level, the block within which farmers were randomly selected. The statistical significance of a coefficient at certain thresholds is indicated by  * $p < 0.10$, ** $p < 0.05$, *** $p < 0.01$.} \\

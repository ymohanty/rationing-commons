\multicolumn{6}{p{0.80\hsize}}{\footnotesize The table shows the distributional impacts of Pigouvian reform on farmer profits. The columns show results for different policy regimes: column 1 is the status quo rationing regime and columns 2 through 4 show regimes with Pigouvian pricing. The Pigouvian regimes differ in the transfers made to farmers and how those transfers are conditioned. In column 2 onwards, the transfer policies are: no transfers, flat (uniform) transfers, transfers pro rata based on pump capacity, and transfers pro rata based on land size. The rows in Panel A show summary statistics on the level of profits under different regimes. The rows in Panel B show summary statistics on the changes in profits between the status quo rationing regime (column 1) and the respective Pigouvian regimes (columns 2 through 5)} \\

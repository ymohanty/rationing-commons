\multicolumn{3}{p{0.3\hsize}}{\footnotesize This table reports the average depths (in feet) of wells dug by sampled farmers in each of the six subdivisional offices in two different periods. $ D_{t}$ denotes the average depth of wells dug between 2000 and 2010. $ D_{t+1}$ denotes the average depth of wells dug between 2010 and 2017. The average time difference between wells dug in these two periods is 7.5 years.}
